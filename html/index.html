      I make websites for small and medium businesses, I do system administration, IT support,
      project management, coding, security, hacking &ndash; problem solving. Not a hero but 
      I like to think I'm versatile, or "shapeless like water".

   <h2>More About Me</h2>
   <p>
      I currently work as an IT Project Manager for The Centre of Integrative Sports Nutrition 
      where Iâ€™m also a hands-on Full Stack Engineer, so not only do I come up with the infrastructure 
      design but I also implement the solutions that lead to fulfilling our goals.
